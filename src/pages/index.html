            <p>Hello Ipsita,</p>
            <p>Ovarian cancer often goes undetected until it has spread within the pelvis and belly. At this late stage,
                ovarian cancer is more difficult to treat and can be fatal.
                Ovarian cancer often has no symptoms in the early stages. Later stages are associated with symptoms, but
                they can be non-specific, such as loss of appetite and weight loss. </p>

            <p>Doctors know that ovarian cancer begins when cells in or near the ovaries develop changes (mutations) in
                their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do. The changes tell the
                cells to grow and multiply quickly, creating a mass (tumor) of cancer cells. The cancer cells continue
                living when healthy cells would die. They can invade nearby tissues and break off from an initial tumor
                to spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.</p>

                ovarian cancer is found and treated before cancer has spread outside the ovary (stages IA and IB), the
                5-year the relative survival rate is 92.5%. However, only 15% of all ovarian cancers are found at this
                early stage. nocc@ovarian.org Information: 888-OVARIAN (888-682-7426) Direct: 214-273-4200</p>

                        If you have a family history of breast and ovarian cancers, bring this up with your doctor. Your
                        doctor can determine what this may mean for your own risk of cancer. You may be referred to a
                        genetic counselor who can help you decide whether genetic testing may be right for you. If
                        you're found to have a gene change that increases your risk of ovarian cancer, you may consider
                        surgery to remove your ovaries to prevent cancer.
